Abstract: The major problem in Thailand related to parking is time violation. Vehicles are not
allowed to park for more than a speciﬁed amount of time. Implementation of closed-circuit television
(CCTV) surveillance cameras along with human labor is the present remedy. However, this paper
presents an approach that can introduce a low-cost time violation tracking system using CCTV, Deep
Learning models, and object tracking algorithms. This approach is fairly new because of its appliance
of the SOTA detection technique, object tracking approach, and time boundary implementations.
YOLOv8, along with the DeepSORT/OC-SORT algorithm, is utilized for the detection and tracking
that allows us to set a timer and track the time violation. Using the same apparatus along with
Deep Learning models and algorithms has produced a better system with better performance. The
performance of both tracking algorithms was well depicted in the results, obtaining MOTA scores
of (1.0, 1.0, 0.96, 0.90) and (1, 0.76, 0.90, 0.83) in four different surveillance data for DeepSORT and
OC-SORT, respectively.

1. Introduction
In Thailand, due to the growing number of vehicular registrations, parking has become
a serious issue and has introduced an unsolved challenge [1]. The rapid increase in car
registrations in Thailand has led to parking problems in cities throughout Thailand. In order
to meet the need for parking spaces, shopping malls and mini-marts are trying to effectively
manage the limited number of parking spaces that are accessible to the public. In Thailand,
mini-marts such as Tesco Express, 7-Eleven, and Mini Big C face a substantial parking
problem due to the limited availability of parking spaces. In a fast-paced environment such
as 7-Eleven with limited parking facilities, it is essential to track the parking time of each
vehicle in the parking lot. This issue of parking violations has attracted the attention of
many mini-mart executives and the general public.
Parking violations include activities such as parking a vehicle in a restricted area
and time limit violations. Figure 1 shows an example of the implementation of a time
restriction parking rule in a mini-mart in Thailand. Most shopping malls and mini-marts
use closed-circuit television (CCTV) in parking lots to observe parking time violations.
Currently, parking violations are manually checked by the relevant authorities. However,
these methods are expensive and incur high labor costs, due to the constant monitoring
required to track incoming and outgoing vehicles. To address the parking space problem,
various existing parking solutions have used IoT devices to provide drivers with real-time
parking details [2]. However, using sensors and hardware, while providing accuracy, also

requires constant maintenance, making it an unideal solution for mini-marts. A low cost
parking violation detection system is still required.
The majority of currently available research focuses on assisting drivers to locate
parking spots. Numerous models have been developed to assist drivers with nearby
parking spaces in real time [3]. However, there are very few studies that have been
conducted to help authorities to manage parking spots effectively. Very few studies have
been conducted regarding parking violations and time restrictions.
Figure 1. Representative parking restriction image, imposing a parking time limit of 15 min for con-
sumers.
Over the past few years, mini-marts in Thailand have adopted the method of allocating
a parking time of 15 min per vehicle outside their stores, in order to keep up with parking
demand. However, this method has not been effective, as additional manpower is required
to record the arrival time and departure time of each car.
Recently, considerable effort has been made to use CCTV cameras to identify illegal
parking practices. Many research studies have employed a Gaussian Mixture Model-based
image segmentation approach to retrieve vehicle information [4,5]. Akhawaji et al. [4]
further utilizing a Kalman ﬁlter to eliminate false alarms and enhance efﬁcient vehicle
tracking. However, the effectiveness of this strategy might be affected if the lighting
conditions in the operating area change. Apart from image processing algorithms, many
Deep Learning algorithms have been deployed to detect parking violations. For instance,
networks such as the Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) and You Only Look Once (YOLO)
have been implemented to identify parking violations [6–8].
This paper introduces a real-time parking time violation tracking algorithm using
closed-circuit cameras and DL models with a tracking algorithm to persist the information
from one frame to its subsequent frame. The algorithm leverages the state-of-the-art object
detection technique, YOLOv8, to identify vehicles within a parking lot. Each detected
vehicle is then assigned a unique ID in the parking lot using DeepSORT/OC-SORT, enabling
efﬁcient monitoring of parking time violations. To ensure good performance across varying
levels of illumination, weather conditions, and short-term obstructions, optimal parameters
were carefully selected for the algorithms. An important advantage of this algorithm
is that it does not require prior knowledge about the Region of Interest (ROI), making it
adaptable to various parking lot scenarios. This research paper presents the implementation
of parking violation detection in a time-series context. The paper’s major contributions can
be summarized as follows:
(1) The proposed algorithm demonstrates effective vehicle detection and tracking
across various natural conditions, exploring the SOTA object detection and tracking models;

(2) The methodology exhibits an accurate and reliable solution to the parking time
violation problem;
(3) This paper introduces a frame-by-frame evaluation with respect to time, which is a
new approach to the problem domain.
The remaining sections of this paper are organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the
background and literature related to object detection and object tracking. Section 3 describes
the details of the proposed parking time violation process, including the experimental
setup and experimental settings of parameters for the algorithms. Section 4 presents the
results and discussion.
2. Related Work
Deep Learning applications have received signiﬁcant traction due to their extensive
research and development. Deep Learning-based methods have been applied in many tasks,
such as classiﬁcation [9], object detection [10], object tracking [11], and healthcare [12–14].
The objective of parking time violation tracking is to identify parking time violations by
vehicles, especially in mini-marts which have a limited parking time. The task involves
implementation of object detection and object tracking. Therefore, the current literature on
object detection and object tracking is discussed accordingly.
2.1. Object Detection
In its early years, the machine learning-based object detection pipeline consisted of
two primary steps: ROI extraction and object classiﬁcation [15]. Based on Zhao et al. [16],
object detection models consist of three phases: selection of region of interest, extraction of
features, and, ﬁnally, classiﬁcation of objects. One common ROI extraction technique uses
sliding windows that move various scales across an image. Exhaustive sliding is, however,
very challenging to apply in practice due to its great processing complexity.
Deep Learning algorithms are extensively implemented for object detection tasks.
They can mainly be categorized into two types, as shown in Figure 2. You Only Look
Once (YOLO) [17] and Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) [18] consider detection tasks
as a regression problem and are one stage networks. On the other hand, algorithms such
as Region-Based CNN (RCNN) [10] ﬁrstly locate the region of interest, which is further
classiﬁed into classes. As depicted in Figure 3, The R-CNN model uses a selective search
algorithm to determine the number of candidates for bounding box object regions, and then
features are fed into CNN, which acts as a feature extractor. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
is used to classify whether the object is present within that candidate region by utilizing the
retrieved features. R-CNN can perform well in various object detection tasks, but training
these models takes signiﬁcant time, and the speed of detection is limited [19].

Figure 3. Flowchart of region-based CNN.
To improve the speed of training and inference, one-stage detectors such as SSD and
YOLO have been introduced for object detection tasks. Figure 4 shows the architecture
of SSD Models. In SSD, CNN-based feature extractors are used. At the end of feature
extraction, convolutional feature layers generate predictions at multiple scales. Since
SSD does not use region based proposals, SSD models have increased detection speed,
as opposed to two-stage detectors such as R-CNN. In this research work, YOLO was
implemented for the object detection task. The details of the YOLO model are discussed
accordingly in the Methodology section.
Figure 4. Flowchart of Single Shot MultiBox Detector.
One of the ﬁrst attempts to tackle the issue of parking lot monitoring using machine
learning utilized color vector features on an SVM classiﬁer to distinguish parking spaces
inside a parking lot in 2002 [20]. Based on a 3D model of parking spaces, Huang et al. [21]
proposed a day and night operating parking space detection system using a Bayesian
hierarchical framework. Apart from Deep Learning models, many image processing
techniques have been implemented to solve parking space detection problems. For instance,
Menéndez et al. [22] proposed temporal analysis of parking area video frames to identify
vacant spaces. This method includes the process of background subtraction using the
Gaussian mixture to identify and track vehicles in the parking lot. In addition, a transience
map was created to observe incoming and outgoing vehicles. Xie et al. [7] proposed an
optimized SSD to detect illegal vehicle parking from a video stream in a robust environment,
achieving 99% accuracy.
Recently, Patel and Meduri [23] presented an automatic parking space detection al-
gorithm that comprised two steps. The ﬁrst step included vehicle detection with Faster
R-CNN and YOLOv4, while vehicle tracking was used to differentiate between moving
and stationary vehicles. Based on Patel and Meduri’s research [23], this technique reduced
the amount of human effort required by up to 90%. Grbi´c and Koch [24] proposed occu-
pancy classiﬁcation and a parking space detection algorithm, wherein parking spaces were
determined as occupied or empty using a trained ResNet34 deep classiﬁer; they extensively
evaluated this approach on publicly known parking datasets such as PKLot [25] and CN-
RPark+EXT [26]. Chen et al. [27] implemented an enhanced SSD (Single Shot MultiBox
Detector) algorithm for the quick recognition of vehicles in trafﬁc scenarios. For feature

extraction, the authors used the MobileNet v2 network, which helped to improve the detec-
tion accuracy of the algorithm. Experimental results showed that the proposed algorithm
achieved 82.59% and 84.83% accuracy for the BDD100K and KITTI datasets, respectively.
By introducing asymmetric convolution and a global point tracking module, Li et al. [28]
proposed YOLO–GCC based on the YOLO algorithm and achieved an average accuracy of
83.0% on the TSD–MAX dataset. Jung et al. [29] proposed classiﬁcation and localization
of vehicles in trafﬁc monitoring, using ResNet50 for vehicle classiﬁcation, adding an opti-
mized drop-down convolutional neural network (DropCNN) to improve the performance
of classiﬁcation.
2.2. Vehicle Tracking
Object tracking is a technique for detecting objects across frames by utilizing their
spatial and temporal characteristics. In its simplest form, the method consists of obtaining
the initial set of detections, giving them distinct IDs, and following them over frames,
which is the essence of object tracking. Over the last decade, object tracking methods have
gained popularity in the ﬁelds of Deep Learning and computer vision.
Single Object Tracking (SOT) and Multiple Object Tracking (MOT) are the two cat-
egories into which object tracking can be subdivided [30]. A Multiple Object Tracking
algorithm’s primary responsibility is to identify multiple objects in a frame, assign and
preserve their identities, and follow the object’s trajectory across input frames.
Object tracking has been used in many domains such as pedestrian tracking [31],
vehicle tracking [32], and player tracking [33]. Parico and Ahamed [34] implemented
YOLOv4 for pear detection and a multiple object tracking algorithm, DeepSORT, for pear
tracking and counting. Hou et al. [32] proposed a tracking algorithm called DeepSORT
and a low-conﬁdence search ﬁlter that reduced false detections produced by the original
DeepSORT algorithm. To track vehicles detected by a YOLOv3 network, Liu and Liu [35]
proposed 3-D constrained multiple kernels aided by Kalman ﬁltering. In this article, we
focus on a closed-circuit television (CCTV)-based multiple object tracking technique, which
allows identiﬁcation of multiple objects in a sequence of images. The effectiveness of
such a tracking method depends on the quality of detection in various weather settings,
the proportion of occlusion, and illumination change. Therefore, it is crucial to choose
the best object detection and tracking algorithm. Aware of our objective, state-of-the-art
tracking algorithms such as DeepSORT and OCSORT were implemented. Table 1 shows
the benchmark results on the DanceTrack dataset. OC-SORT outperforms all the existing
tracking algorithm in many metrics, such as HOTA, AssA and IDF1. This result shows
strong evidence of the high performance of the OC-SORT Algorithm.

3.1. Dataset
Due to limitations and privacy concerns, acquiring mini-mart data was not possible.
As such, the dataset was comprised of video footage obtained from CCTV cameras installed
at King Mongkut’s Institute of Technology, Ladkrabang (KMITL). The CCTV model utilized
at KMITL is the Panasonic V series, which offers a 15–30 frames per second (FPS) capture
rate and a 1080P resolution. These cameras are IP66 rated, providing resistance to water
and dust.
Data collection was conducted using 4 cameras placed at different locations within the
university campus, all with a resolution of 1080P and a frame rate of 15 FPS. The selection
of dataset locations was carefully carried out to incorporate diverse camera angles and
viewpoints. The video samples within the dataset encompassed various daylight and
weather settings, offering a comprehensive representation of the parking lot scenarios at
KMITL.
3.2. Vehicle Detection
In 2015, Joseph Redmon and Ali Farhadi from the University of Washington created
the cutting-edge object recognition algorithm called YOLO (You Only Look Once) [17].
YOLO outperforms many other object detection algorithms such as R-CNN and DPM [17].
YOLO sees the entire image during training and testing, in contrast to sliding window-
and region proposal-based approaches, implicitly capturing contextual information about
classes as well as their appearance. The initial version of YOLO had the ability to quickly
recognize objects in images, but it had trouble locating smaller objects precisely. Since
the data in our problem domain does not contain very small images, there is no problem
using YOLO for this study. YOLO divides input images into a grid of dimensions M × M.
For instance, a grid cell is in charge of detecting an object if its center falls inside that
grid cell. Each grid cell predicts the bounding box and offers a conﬁdence score for the
associated boxes. In YOLO, conﬁdence is described as Pr(Object) × IOU where Pr(Object)
represents the probability of the presence of an object, and IOU represents the Intersection
over Union (IOU), i.e., the overlap area between inference and ground truth. Each grid
cell generates ﬁve predictions (x, y, w, h, and a conﬁdence score). Additionally, each grid
produces p conditional class probabilities, expressed as Pr(Class|Object). Equation (2) below
demonstrates the method to obtain class-speciﬁc conﬁdence scores for each box during the
test phase.
Classi × IOUtruth
pred = Classi | Object × Object × IOUtruth

The ﬁnal layers predict both the coordinates of their bounding boxes and their associ-
ated class probabilities. Then, the bounding boxes are normalized to fall between 0 and 1.
All further layers increase non-linearity by using the leaky rectiﬁed linear activation func-
tion, as described in Equation (2), with an exception of the ﬁnal layer, which employs a
linear activation function:
f (x) =
(
x,
if x > 0.
0.1x,
otherwise.

In 2016, YOLOv2 was released, improving on the original model by including batch
normalization, anchor boxes, and dimension clusters [40]. Similarly, YOLOv3 was released
in 2018, improving the model’s performance by employing a more efﬁcient backbone
network, incorporating a feature pyramid, and employing focal loss [41]. The initial model
of YOLO had many successors, including YOLOv4, YOLOv5, YOLOv6, and YOLOv7.
In 2023, YOLOv8 was released by Ultralytics [39]. Figure 5 shows the detailed architecture
of YOLOv8. Figure 6–9 show images of the dataset.
In the backbone architecture, the C2f module, based on Cross Stage Partial (CSP), is
used in YOLOv8, as opposed to the C3 Module used in YOLOv5. The architecture of CSP
enhances the learning capacity of CNN and decreases the computational effort of the model.
The C2f module comprises two Conv Modules and n BottleNeck, connected through Split

3.3. Movement Tracking
Once successfully able to detect vehicles in a parking lot, object tracking algorithms
could be deployed to track the vehicles. Two tracking algorithms were implemented in
the research. The ﬁrst algorithm was DeepSORT. Figure 10 shows the workﬂow of our
algorithm. The DeepSORT algorithm was implemented to track each vehicle throughout
the frame. DeepSORT is an extension of SORT (Simple Online Realtime Tracking) [11].
DeepSORT uses appearance descriptors to minimize identity shifts, increasing the effec-
tiveness of tracking. For problems involving the prediction of temporal or time series data,
Kalman ﬁltering is the used algorithm.
Figure 10. Workﬂow of our proposed work.
The second tracking algorithm that was implemented was Observation-Centric SORT
(OC-SORT) [38]. OC-SORT was published in CVPR 2023. On numerous datasets, including
MOT17, MOT20, KITTI, head tracking, and, particularly, DanceTrack, where the object mo-
tion is very non-linear, OC-SORT produces state-of-the-art results. To improve the accuracy
and robustness during a period of occlusion, OC-SORT implements object observations to
compute a virtual trajectory. Figure 11 shows the pipeline of OC-SORT.

Figure 11. Pipeline of OC-SORT.
3.4. Time Violation
After successful integration of vehicle detection, followed by vehicle tracking that
assigns a unique ID to each unique vehicle, a simple time violation algorithm was deployed
to track every car in the frame. Every minute, the presence of the vehicle was checked.
If the vehicle did not exist in the next 10 consecutive frames, then the ID of the vehicle was
discarded. On the other hand, if the ID was present in 15 consecutive frames, the vehicle
was determined to have violated the time restriction. In the ﬁgure, a blue label is associated
with no violation, while a red label is associated with violation.
3.5. Experimental Setup
This section discusses the experimental platform, providing details of the in-depth
ﬂow of the algorithm, including the chosen parameters. The workstation used for the
experiment was Ubuntu Linux. All experiments were conducted in a 3.6 GHz Intel Xeon
Quad-Core processor with 8GB RAM and an NVIDIA Quadro P4000 graphics card.
A Mean Average Precision (mAP) of 53.9 was achieved by YOLOv8x, which was
higher than all other YOLO versions. Therefore, YOLOv8x was chosen for vehicle detection.
A pretrained model was used, as the class was already trained on the MS COCO dataset.
The resolution of the video feed was 1080P (1920 × 1080), with a frame rate of 15 fps.
For YOLOv8, the image-size parameter was set to 640. The model thus resized the longest
dimension to be 640, i.e., size 1920 became 640, while maintaining the aspect ratio. Therefore,
the resized images were close to 640 × 360. Classes were ﬁltered to be (2, 5, 7) i.e., car,
bus, and truck, as the violation algorithm was checking for big vehicles. The conﬁdence
threshold was set to 0.5. The probability of the class occurring in the bounding box was
evaluated using the conﬁdence score. The maximum object detection parameter was set
to 100.
For tracking vehicles, DeepSORT/OC-SORT tracking algorithms were used. The max-
age parameter was set to 10. For DeepSORT algorithm, Max Age preserves the ID of a
vehicle for a threshold number of frames before deleting the ID. The n_init parameter was
set to 2. The n_init parameter refers to the number of objects detected before initializing
the tracking of the object. max_cosine_distance was set to 0.3. Max cosine distance was
the threshold to identify vehicle similarity by the DeepSORT algorithm. The trajectory
parameter was set to False, as the trajectory of the vehicle over time was not required.
3.6. Validation Criteria
Object detection algorithms such as YOLOv8 use Mean Average Precision (mAP) to
validate the performance of object detection. Since the objective of this work was to track
vehicles across a frame, it was essential to validate the results with an object tracking
algorithm. MOTA (Multiple Object Tracking Algorithm) metrics were used to validate the
results. MOTA metrics measure the accuracy of both detection and tracking algorithms.
Firstly, it was essential to deﬁne True Positive (TP), False Positive (FP), False Negative (FN),
and True Negative (TN). Table 2 shows the detailed deﬁnitions. The formula for MOTA is
shown in Equation (3). FN refers to no match for the ground truth object. This can occur

--- Page 10 ---
Sensors 2023, 23, 5843
10 of 14
because of various reasons, such as the vehicle being too far away from the camera, weather,
different illumination, etc. FP refers to no ground truth object but a match by the algorithm.
There was one instance of FP where the reﬂection of the vehicle was considered as a vehicle.
False IDs refer to identiﬁcation switches between the tracked vehicles. GT refers to total
ground truth object.

4. Results and Discussion
Figure 12 illustrates samples of vehicle detection and tracking, using YOLOv8 with
two different object tracking algorithms across various daylight and weather settings.The
performance of YOLOv8 with DeepSORT proved to be superior for the dataset in contrast
to the recently introduced OC-SORT algorithm, which had exhibited notable advancements
across numerous MOT datasets. MOTA scores of (1.0, 1.0, 0.96, 0.90) and (1, 0.76, 0.90, 0.8)
were achieved for DeepSORT and OC-SORT tracking algorithms as shown in Table 3. The
OC-SORT algorithm did not exhibit satisfactory results on this speciﬁc dataset. It consis-
tently encountered challenges in maintaining consistent vehicle identiﬁcation, particularly
in the presence of rainy conditions. The algorithm frequently switched vehicle IDs, leading
to inaccuracies in tracking which impacted the overall performance. In Figures 13 and 14,
the tracking of each algorithm on the Location 2 dataset can be observed. In the provided
sample frame (f23401) from both Figures 13 and 14, it is observed that the DeepSORT
algorithm successfully tracked the vehicle IDs, while the OC-SORT algorithm struggled to
accurately track the IDs. The challenges faced by OC-SORT in correctly tracking the IDs
could potentially be attributed to factors such as rainy weather conditions and the presence
of visually similar vehicles in close proximity. These factors may have led to difﬁculties in
distinguishing between vehicles, resulting in ID switching. The robustness of DeepSORT
in handling such scenarios could be attributed to its utilization of deep appearance feature
embedding, which allows for more reliable tracking, even in challenging conditions. In
the case of Location 1, the count for False Negatives (FN) was observed to be 3 and 4 for
DeepSORT and OC-SORT, respectively, due to the presence of reﬂections from vehicles on
the windows. These reﬂections interfered with the vehicle detection process, causing some
vehicles to be falsely labeled as negatives which, thus, affected the MOTA scores.
Overall, based on the experiment conducted, it is clear that the performance of the
vehicle tracking algorithm is greatly inﬂuenced by factors such as camera position and
weather variation, particularly when using a single camera for inference. To achieve optimal
tracking results, positioning the camera at or near a top-view perspective can greatly en-
hance the performance of the vehicle tracking algorithm. This camera placement minimizes
the occurrence of vehicle overlapping, leading to improved tracking accuracy. By capturing
a top-down view of the monitored area, the camera can provide a clear and unobstructed
line of sight to the vehicles, reducing the chances of them overlapping or obstructing each
other. This unambiguous view allows the tracking algorithm to more accurately detect and
track individual vehicles, ensuring reliable and precise tracking results. Thus, selecting a
top-view perspective for camera placement is crucial in minimizing vehicle overlap and
maximizing the effectiveness of the vehicle tracking algorithms.

5. Conclusions
Manual parking time violation tracking is unideal, due to its requirements for man-
power and high cost. In this research paper, a parking time violation tracking algorithm was
successfully demonstrated; this has the potential to reduce additional manpower and labor
costs. The algorithm can be implemented in many parking lot settings. The YOLOv8 algo-
rithm was used to detect vehicles in the parking lot, while DeepSORT and OC-SORT were
used to track the vehicles throughout the frame. For the DeepSORT algorithm, the MOTA
scores were recorded as (1.0, 1.0, 0.96, 0.90) across four different surveillance datasets. This
indicates a high level of accuracy and effectiveness in tracking multiple objects. On the
other hand, the OC-SORT algorithm achieved MOTA scores of (1.0, 0.76, 0.90, 0.83) across
the same datasets. While still achieving relatively high scores, there is a slight variation
compared to DeepSORT, particularly in the second dataset, where the MOTA score dropped
to 0.76 due to frequent ID switching. Overall, both algorithms showcased their ability
to effectively track objects in the given surveillance data. These results provide valuable
insights into the tracking performance of each algorithm and can aid in selecting the most
suitable algorithm based on speciﬁc tracking requirements and dataset characteristics. The
performance of the detection model might be increased by customized training of the model
with vehicles. This is not necessary, but may help the algorithm to become more robust.
In future studies, researchers can explore the synchronization of the algorithm with
two or more cameras. This synchronization would enable the algorithm to detect parking
time violations in situations where multiple CCTV cameras are deployed. By integrating
the feeds from multiple cameras, the algorithm can gather a more comprehensive view of
the parking lot, improving the accuracy of violation detection. This scalability is important
for expanding the algorithm’s applicability to larger parking areas or scenarios where
multiple cameras are already in use.
